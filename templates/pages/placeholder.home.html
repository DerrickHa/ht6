  <p class="lead">Using the recycling machine is simple and intuitive, ensuring that everyone can contribute to a sustainable environment:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong style="color:#3EB489">Sort Your Waste:</strong> Begin by sorting your waste into recyclables and non-recyclables.</li>
    <li><strong style="color:#3EB489">Feed the Machine:</strong> Place your trash into the designated slot on the machine. The advanced sensors will automatically detect the type of material.</li>
    <li><strong style="color:#3EB489">Processing:</strong> The machine uses machine learning algorithms to sort the trash further if needed and processes them accordingly.</li>
    <li><strong style="color:#3EB489">Confirmation:</strong> Once the process is complete, the machine will provide a confirmation of whether the trash belongs in the garbage or the recycling.
    The machine will reward you with points depending on if you choose the right place for the trash to go to.</li>
